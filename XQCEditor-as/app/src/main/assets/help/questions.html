<H1>Frequently Asked Questions</H1>

<H3>Who is this site meant for?</H3>
There are no "Introduction to Programming" tutorials here.  
This site is meant to be used by more-or-less experienced C++ programmers, who
have a good idea of what they want to do and simply need to look up the syntax.
If you're interested in learning C/C++, try one of these sites:
<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="http://www.howstuffworks.com/c.htm">How C Programming Works</A>
  <LI><A HREF="http://www.strath.ac.uk/CC/Courses/NewCcourse/ccourse.html">C Programming</A>
  <LI><A HREF="http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial.html">C++ Made Easy</A>
</UL>

<H3>Does this site contain a complete and definitive list of C/C++ functions?</H3>
Few things in life are absolute.
If you don't find what you are looking for
here, don't assume that it doesn't exist.  Do a search on 
<A HREF="http://www.google.com">Google</A> for it.

<H3>Is there an archived version of this site available?</H3>
You can download an archived version of cppreference.com 
<A HREF="cppreference-files.tar.gz">here</A>.  If you're interested
in getting archived versions of websites in general, you might want to 
check out utilities like 
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html">GNU's wget</A>
(Windows version 
<A HREF="http://www.interlog.com/~tcharron/wgetwin.html">here</A>).

<H3>Some of the examples on this site don't work on my system.  What's going on?</H3>
Most of the code on this site was compiled under 
<A HREF="http://www.linux.com">Linux</A> 
(<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</A> or 
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org">Debian</A>) with the
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</A>
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">Compiler Collection</A>.
Since this site is merely a reference for the 
<A HREF="http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/product.asp?sku=ISO%2FIEC+14882%3A2003">
Standard C and C++ specification</A>, (check 
<A HREF="http://www.ncits.org/cplusplus.htm">here</A>, too)
not every compiler will support every function listed here.  For example,
<UL>
  <!-- <LI>I've never had much luck getting 
      <A HREF="cppbitset.html">C++ Bitsets</A>
      to work on my computer - but they're listed here.  not needed now -->
  <LI>Header files change like mad.  To include the necessary support for 
      <A HREF="cppvector.html">C++ Vectors</A>, 
      you might have to use any of these: 
      <PRE>
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;Vector&gt;
#include &lt;vector.h&gt;</PRE>
      (according to the spec, the first of those should work, and the compiler should
      know enough to use it to reference the real vector header file.)  
  <LI>Another header file issue is that newer compilers can use a more 
      platform-independent commands to include standard C libraries.  For example,
      you might be able to use 
      <PRE>
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;</PRE>
      instead of
      <PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</PRE>
  <LI>All of the code on this site assumes that the correct namespace has been
      designated.  If your compiler is a little old, then you might be able to get
      away with using simple statements like:
      <PRE>
      cout << "hello world!";</PRE>
      However, newer compilers require that you either use
      <PRE>
      std::cout << "hello world!";</PRE>
      or declare what namespace to use with the "using namespace" command.
  <LI>Certain popular compilers (like the one shipped with Microsoft's Visual C++)
      have alternative or additions to the C++ Standard Template Library.
      For example, the MFC in Visual C++ provides you with the string type "CString",
      which has string functionality but is not part of the C++ STL.
</UL>
...The list goes on and on.  In other words, individual results may vary.
